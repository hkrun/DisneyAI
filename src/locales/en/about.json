            "section2P1": "Everyone who creates content understands two pain points: first, 'monotonous style'—using traditional methods to create content results in audience retention rates below 10 seconds; second, 'high cost'—hiring professional animators costs at least $50-100 per hour, which small and medium creators simply can't afford.",

Now single videos consistently get over 100,000 views with 60% increased engagement.",

Old Zhang, who does creative design, was stuck on 'style matching'—children's illustrations need cartoon style, adult illustrations need realistic style, each style requiring redesign with high costs. After using Disney style conversion technology, he just uploads client photos, switches 'princess style', 'superhero style', 'fairy tale style' with one click, providing precise services for different client needs, increasing client satisfaction from 60% to 90%.",
            "section3P3": "Case 3: Social media content creator who caught trending traffic with 'instant style conversion'.

Xiao Chen from Guangzhou now uses Disney style conversion technology, first shooting 'holiday-themed photos', then generating 'holiday animation style + creative copy' in 10 minutes, going live on trend day.

            "section4P3": "Don't exaggerate conversion effects: Disney style conversion is just a 'creative tool'; core is still content quality and creativity. Don't mislead audiences with 'false effect packaging', or risk platform penalties.",

Case: Beijing education institution in children's education track, after Disney style conversion producing 6 hours content daily, costs halved, views increased from 80,000/day to 200,000/day.",

Same day: morning use 'princess style' for educational content; afternoon use 'superhero style' for entertainment content; evening use 'fairy tale style' for parenting content. Prepare photo materials in advance, backend set 'scheduled style switching + auto-publish', equals 1 person operating 3 platforms, 24 hours capturing traffic.",
